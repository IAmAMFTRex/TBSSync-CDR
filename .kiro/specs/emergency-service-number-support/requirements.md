# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current CDR processing system filters out all 3-digit emergency and service numbers (911, 411, etc.) due to phone number validation logic that only accepts 10-digit numbers. This creates a significant gap in billing and reporting data, as emergency calls and directory assistance calls should be tracked for compliance, billing, and operational reporting purposes.

This feature will enhance the phone number cleaning logic to properly handle and preserve 3-digit emergency and service numbers while maintaining existing validation for regular 10-digit phone numbers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a telecom billing administrator, I want 911 emergency calls to be properly processed and stored in the CDR system, so that I can maintain complete call records for compliance and reporting purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CDR record contains "911" as the DNIS THEN the system SHALL preserve "911" as a valid destination number
2. WHEN a CDR record contains "911" as the ANI THEN the system SHALL preserve "911" as a valid source number
3. WHEN processing 911 calls THEN the system SHALL NOT generate invalid phone number warnings for the 911 number
4. WHEN 911 calls are stored in the database THEN they SHALL be stored with "911" as the exact value without padding or modification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a telecom billing administrator, I want 411 directory assistance calls to be properly processed and stored in the CDR system, so that I can accurately bill customers for directory assistance services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CDR record contains "411" as the DNIS THEN the system SHALL preserve "411" as a valid destination number
2. WHEN a CDR record contains "411" as the ANI THEN the system SHALL preserve "411" as a valid source number
3. WHEN processing 411 calls THEN the system SHALL NOT generate invalid phone number warnings for the 411 number
4. WHEN 411 calls are stored in the database THEN they SHALL be stored with "411" as the exact value without padding or modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a telecom billing administrator, I want other 3-digit service numbers (511, 611, 711, 811) to be properly processed and stored in the CDR system, so that I can maintain complete records of all service-related calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CDR record contains any valid 3-digit service number (511, 611, 711, 811) as the DNIS THEN the system SHALL preserve it as a valid destination number
2. WHEN a CDR record contains any valid 3-digit service number as the ANI THEN the system SHALL preserve it as a valid source number
3. WHEN processing 3-digit service numbers THEN the system SHALL NOT generate invalid phone number warnings for valid service numbers
4. WHEN 3-digit service numbers are stored in the database THEN they SHALL be stored with their exact 3-digit value without padding or modification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a telecom billing administrator, I want the system to maintain existing validation for 10-digit phone numbers, so that data quality is preserved while adding support for service numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CDR record contains a 10-digit phone number THEN the system SHALL continue to apply existing validation rules
2. WHEN a CDR record contains an invalid 10-digit phone number (all zeros, invalid area code) THEN the system SHALL continue to filter it out as invalid
3. WHEN a CDR record contains a phone number that is not 3-digit service number or valid 10-digit number THEN the system SHALL filter it out as invalid
4. WHEN processing phone numbers THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing 10-digit number processing logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear logging and error reporting for phone number processing, so that I can monitor data quality and identify any processing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes 3-digit service numbers THEN it SHALL log the count of service numbers processed
2. WHEN the system encounters an unrecognized 3-digit number THEN it SHALL log a warning with the specific number
3. WHEN generating invalid phone number alerts THEN the system SHALL exclude valid 3-digit service numbers from the invalid count
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL report separate counts for 10-digit numbers, 3-digit service numbers, and invalid numbers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a telecom billing administrator, I want the database schema to properly accommodate 3-digit service numbers, so that all call data is stored correctly without truncation or formatting issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 3-digit service numbers are stored in the database THEN the existing varchar field sizes SHALL accommodate them without modification
2. WHEN querying CDR data THEN 3-digit service numbers SHALL be retrievable in their original format
3. WHEN generating reports THEN 3-digit service numbers SHALL be distinguishable from 10-digit phone numbers
4. WHEN performing database operations THEN 3-digit service numbers SHALL not cause constraint violations or data type errors
